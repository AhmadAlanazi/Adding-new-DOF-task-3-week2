 Adding-new-DOF-task-3-week2

the task is about adding a new Degree of freedom. To do that you need to add a new link to the robot arm.

the link is designed in a way that has a place where you can put the motor or Arduino.
The new link is placed between arm1 and arm2.

I used Solidwork to design the link and blender to assembly them.
